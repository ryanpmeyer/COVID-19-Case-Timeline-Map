# COVID-19 case dashboard

This repository contains a jupyter notebook which displays an interactive timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in the united states. Case data is displayed per diem on a choropleth map, while important news stories such as superspreader events are also included.

To view the map without running the notebook locally, visit https://gesis.mybinder.org/binder/v2/gist/ryanpmeyer/61dd111220cf824d1b0b6def9a4b9f1e/626825f52b76a552897ae34c949f9d2f35e610c4?filepath=Final%20Notebook.ipynb
