    "First, we load in the covid case data, US Census 2019 population estimates, as well as some GeoJSON data containing county geometry. Some cleaning needs to be done to match the format of FIPS codes between datasets. Additionally, population dataset needs to be cleaned, then joined via census area names. Finally, after dividing the joined table by the data from the US population table, we yield the final dataset: a dataframe of covid cases per capita for each county for each day. This will be used to look at how COVID-19 spread across the United States over the course of 2020."

I encourage you to remember the stories presented and follow along how the map changes in the following weeks. COVID-19 has a latent period between infection and symptoms, and exponential spreading following a superspreader event takes a few weeks to manifest as well."

    "In short, this map takes you through the growth and spread of COVID-19 across the United States. It is important to note that the color scale for the choropleth is relative, meaning for each date the deepest red is reserved for the county with the highest cases per capita. This means that when the map is redder overall, it suggests that COVID-19 is spreading evenly throughout the counties rather than being concentrated within hot spots. This is the trend that is observed overall: despite various prevention policies and measures designed to curb the spreading of COVID-19, time and again case spikes originate in singular locations before spreading outwards radially into neighboring regions. Super spreading events precede large shifts from blue to red in the general area they occurred in. States which roll back pandemic restrictions or reopen businesses while the virus’ spread remains uncontrolled see massive breakouts which do not cease to this day. The end result is an overwhelming sense of dread, scrolling along the timeline of the map. Dating back to as early as January, it was clear to informed newsreaders that the virus would be no joke. What followed has been nearly a full year of little collective action, and a nation that gets sicker and sicker with no clear end in sight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Worst of all, what is never observed on this map are clear 1st and 2nd “waves” of coronavirus. Although many media headlines claim that the current record highs in case and death numbers are a “second wave” of the virus, the true reality is that COVID-19 never really stopped spreading. Any pauses in the acceleration of the virus were brief and quickly countered by new, larger exposures in other places. The map begins as a clean blue before COVID-19 hotspots appear like pimples on skin. These red splotches sometimes go away, as is the case with several of the early spikes which were swiftly dealt with and carefully managed by local health officials. In other cases, what initially appears as events localized to a single county spirals into a massive epidemic plaguing entire groups of states. What remains is a single, inevitable takeaway: this virus is a significant danger, and absolutely will not go away on its own. The only way to survive such exponential growth is to ensure the isolation and quarantine of every single exposure before the law of large numbers takes hold. But looking at the final few months of data, it seems that we may already be past the point of no return.\n"
